# Fantasy Football Rankings Predictor for 2025

### Description:

The code in this repository ranks NFL skill positions (QB, RB, WR and TE) for fantasy in 2025. The codebase includes data from 2005 till 2024. We will use a neural network to help predict the rankings of players and several models to determine which is best suited for this type of application.

Features (SUBJECT TO CHANGE):
- Player Stats (Rushing/Receiving and Passing Yards, Rushing/Receiving and Passing TDs, Receptions, Targets, Carries, Pass Attempts, Yards per Touch, Consistency - Std deviation of weekly half ppr ppg)
- Age
- Depth Chart
- Vacated Opportunities / Increased Competition
- Draft Capital, Combine Data, College Stats (Rookies)
- Strength of Schedule?


### Rookies:

Rookie rankings will be a challenge, as they have not played a snap in the NFL, and we will therefore need to make some predictions for rookie stats. Using college stats from the previous 5-10 years, and matching our 2025 rookies with comparable rookie seasons from prior years, we will hopefully be able to place the rookies in the rankings.
